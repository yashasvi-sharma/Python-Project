# Python Assignment

Data Processing Task:
Write a Python function that takes a dictionary of employee records as input. Each record should contain an employeeâ€™s name, department, and monthly salary. The function should return the total salary expense for each department, as well as the average salary per department. Make sure to handle cases where departments may have no employees.

String Manipulation Task:
Write a Python function that takes a sentence as input and returns the most frequently occurring word. If there is a tie, return the word that appears first in the sentence. Ignore punctuation and case while counting word frequency.

Algorithm Challenge - Sorting and Searching:
Write a Python function to implement binary search on a sorted list of integers. The function should take a list and a target value as input and return the index of the target value in the list. If the target value is not found, return -1. Avoid using built-in search functions.

Bonus Challenge (Optional):

Create a Python script that reads a CSV file containing information about products (e.g., product ID, name, category, price) and filters out products based on a specified price range and category. Output the results to a new CSV file.

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to the following tasks:

1. **Data Processing Task**: Calculate total and average salary for each department.
2. **String Manipulation Task**: Find the most frequently occurring word in a sentence.
3. **Algorithm Challenge**: Implement binary search on a sorted list.
4. **Bonus Challenge**: Filter products from a CSV file based on price and category.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run each script independently to test functionality.
3. For the bonus challenge, ensure `products.csv` exists in the directory.

## Usage Examples

Each script includes example usage for easy testing. 

### Optional:
- Include input and output CSV files for testing.
