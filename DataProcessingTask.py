# Data Processing Task:
# Write a Python function that takes a dictionary of employee records as input.
# Each record should contain an employeeâ€™s name, department, and monthly salary.
# The function should return the total salary expense for each department, as well as the average salary per department.
# Make sure to handle cases where departments may have no employees.
